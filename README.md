# punWord
This is a tricky word game. Give a short word (e.g. 'SUN'), find a longer word including the short word (e.g. 'SUNshine(sunshine)', 'SUNt(saint)'). Outputs do not have to be the exact same word, they could be some words with the similar pronunciation. Linux original dataset and google-10k-word dataset are used in this approach. Result words are sorted by Levenshtein distance. See solution.pdf for more information.
